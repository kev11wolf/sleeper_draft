    "summaries":{
      "brendankane":["You bullied the turn like a pro: Nabers + JT + Harrison Jr. gives you weekly nuclear upside with Walker/Worthy to keep the fireworks going.","Kelce at value plus Pitts on the bench is pure â€˜luxury flexâ€™ energy, and Jaylen Warren/Chubb are bye-week hammers.","Strength: Elite WR room with true WR1 ceilings everywhere and two top-20 RBs â€” this is matchup-proof.","Weakness: QB room (Mayfield/Cam Ward) is the only soft spot â€” stream aggressively early if Baker sputters."],
      "Bigboiseason":["This is how you draft a juggernaut: Jefferson + London + Breece gives you three weekly top-12 anchors.","Burrow/Engram stabilize the floor while Stevenson/Najee/Monty provide bully-ball depth at RB.","Strength: Balance across positions with elite WRs and multiple starting-caliber RBs â€” injuries wonâ€™t sink you.","Weakness: Riceâ€™s 2025 volatility could swing some weeks; if he hits, youâ€™re a problem for the league."],
      "Milesbarrios":["Chase + Garrett Wilson is a spicy WR duo, and Bucky + Aaron Jones + Mixon give you steady half-PPR juice.","Kylerâ€™s rushing plus Andrews at TE means youâ€™re live for spike weeks without sacrificing floor.","Strength: Depth at RB (Mixon/Jones/Irving/Ray Davis) to survive injuries and bye weeks.","Weakness: WR3 relies on Ladd McConkey hitting fast â€” otherwise youâ€™re living on two aces."],
      "Adamloo":["Bijan + Kyren is a grown-man RB start â€” volume and receiving in a half-PPR league is chefâ€™s kiss.","Mahomes/Stroud is unnecessary but hilarious; you cornered elite QB upside.","Strength: Multiple high-floor WRs (JSN, Kupp, Ridley) to rotate based on matchups.","Weakness: TE is thin (Tyler Warren/Jonnu) â€” youâ€™ll be fishing waivers if Warren doesnâ€™t pop."],
      "Nforbes6":["Gibbs/McBride/Davante is a nasty core and you backed it with upside rookies (Hunter/Pearsall).","Bo Nix + Fields gives you weekly rushing juice at QB without paying a premium.","Strength: Elite TE advantage and strong WR depth (Adams/Addison/Downs).","Weakness: RB2 (Chase Brown/TreVeyon) needs to hold â€” White in the 13th was clutch insurance."],
      "Mmalsin":["Saquon + Lamar + Bowers is a playoff-ready spine with week-winning ceilings at three spots.","Waddle/Diggs can carry you when the Commanders offense slows down.","Strength: Elite QB/TE edges that most teams canâ€™t match.","Weakness: RB depth behind Barkley is green (Harvey/Kaleb/Blue) â€” youâ€™ll live on waivers."],
      "Mattyoungin":["CMC + James Cook + Brian Robinson is a very stable RB room, and Deebo/Sutton/Brian Thomas bring weekly splash plays.","Njoku with Drake Maye is a fun stack to squeeze red-zone equity late in the season.","Strength: Tons of touches â€” this roster screams consistency in half-PPR.","Weakness: WR room depends on rookie pops (Brian Thomas, Tet, Burden) â€” volatility alert."],
      "Michaelb555":["Hurts to A.J. Brown with DK/Olave/DJ Moore? Thatâ€™s a war crime.","Henry plus Charbonnet/Dobbins is a workable committee if the vets hold up.","Strength: Elite weekly QB/WR stacks â€” youâ€™ll lead the league in â€˜I hate playing youâ€™ texts.","Weakness: RB age/injury risk is real; you may need to churn that spot aggressively by October."],
      "Mattcinelli":["CeeDee + Higgins + DeVonta is unfair, and Kittle still erases TE headaches.","Josh Allen covers any lineup sins with QB1 overall upside every week.","Strength: Passing-game dominance with elite QB + deep WR room.","Weakness: RB room (Swift/Bigsby/Mason) is light â€” trade a WR for a locked-in RB2."],
      "Italiangardettos":["Amon-Ra + Puka is pure target hog life; Jayden Daniels adds Konami-code upside at QB.","Pacheco/Javonte/Allgeier is a functional RB trio with touchdown paths.","Strength: Safe WR volume with legit YAC â€” half-PPR friendly.","Weakness: TE room is middling (Kraft/Ferguson) and RBs need efficiency to keep pace."],
      "Biggojohnson":["You opened RB avalanche (Jacobs/Achane/Kamara/Conner) then landed Flowers + Jameson + Egbuka â€” upside city.","Kincaid + Herbert/Prescott gives you weekly stability at TE/QB with ceiling games baked in.","Strength: RB depth to bully trades and survive bye weeks.","Weakness: WRs rely on second-year leaps; if they stall, points could be streaky."],
      "Moneymike805":["Missing the 1.11 then still walking out with Tyreek, Nico, Evans, Pittman, Reed and Aiyuk is straight theft.","LaPorta at TE with Etienne/Pollard/Judkins is a perfectly balanced core, and Purdy distributes dimes.","Strength: Deepest WR room in the league and an elite TE.","Weakness: RB depth after Etienne/Pollard leans on rookies â€” keep the waiver wire warm."]
